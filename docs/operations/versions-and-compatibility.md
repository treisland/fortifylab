# Versions and compatibility

Fortify product releases, Helm chart versions, and container image tags are
separate identifiers. `.env.example` records this repository's tested lab
profile; an override is drift, even when a pod starts successfully.

Before changing a version, compare Fortify release notes and chart requirements,
database major versions, Kubernetes compatibility, and upgrade sequencing.
Record the old profile and migration/rollback limitations. Never assume Helm
rollback reverses a schema migration, and never wipe a PVC to resolve a version
mismatch without explicit data-destruction approval.

“Tested profile” means tested for this lab topology only. It is not a production
support or compatibility certification.
